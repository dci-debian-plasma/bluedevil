Description: KDE Bluetooth stack
 BlueDevil is a set of components which integrate Bluetooth in KDE.
 It contains:
  * A KDE Control Module (KCM) to configure all the Bluetooth-related options.
  * Integration with the KDE input/output system (KIO), which allows you to
    discover and explore Bluetooth devices from your favorite file browser.
  * A wizard to pair your devices and connect directly to services they offer,
    such as input (mouse, keyboard, Wiimote) and audio (headsets, phones).
  * A system tray application from where all BlueDevil actions can be done
    (disconnect devices, send files, configure, etc...)
  * A daemon to listen incoming requests, for example to receive files
    or to introduce a requested PIN.
